## 5. ANSWER: DO VALID PULLBACKS EXIST?

### ✅ YES - Valid Pullbacks Exist

- **14 pullback evaluations occurred in the target zone (50-70%)**
- **172 total pullback evaluations on bars AFTER OR breakout**
- **Pullbacks are now being evaluated on bars AFTER OR breakout (fix confirmed)**
- **Fix is working: pullback logic no longer deadlocked**

**Entry Status:**
- 13 pullback entries were generated (from all retracement zones)
- 0 entries from target zone (50-70%) - engulfing/strong close requirements not met in target zone
- Entries likely generated from deeper retracements (>70%) that still met pullback zone price criteria
